### Explore US Bikeshare Data
Replace the Project Title

### Description
This project uses Python and the popular libraries pandas and NumPy to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States for the Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree project from Udacity. The cities included are Chicago, New York City, and Washington DC. The code allows an interactive experience for the user. The user can filter the data by month or by day of the week. The project returns descriptive statistics about the data.

###### These statistics include the following information regarding the date of the rental:
1) The day of the week that occurred most frequently in the data set
2) The month that occurred most frequently in the data set
3) The hour of the day that occurred most frequently in the data set

###### The following statistics are included regarding location of the Bikeshare:
1) The starting station that was most frequent
2) The ending station that was most frequent
3) The combination of starting and ending station that was most frequent

###### The following statistics related to trip duration are included:
1) The total travel time
2) The average travel time

Lastly, the following customer related statistics are included:
1) Number of users by gender
2) Earliest year of birth in the data set
3) Most recent year of birth in the data set
4) Most frequently occurring year of birth in the data set

Interaction with the project takes place within the terminal.
The user also has the ability to view the raw filtered data 5 rows at a time.

### Note
The .csv file for Washington DC is missing gender and date of birth data. These statistics are not shown when the user selects 'washington'.

### Requirements
1) Python 3.6 or greater
2) pandas
3) NumPy
